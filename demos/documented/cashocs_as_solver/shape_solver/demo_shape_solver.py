# (demo_shape_solver)=
# # cashocs as Solver for Shape Optimization Problems
#
# ## Problem Formulation
#
# Let us now investigate how cashocs can be used exclusively as a solver for shape
# optimization problems. The procedure is very similar to the one discussed in
# {ref}`demo_control_solver`, but with some minor variations tailored to shape
# optimization.
#
# As a model shape optimization problem we consider the same as in
# {ref}`demo_shape_poisson`, i.e.,
#
# $$
# \begin{align}
#     &\min_\Omega J(u, \Omega) = \int_\Omega u \text{ d}x \\
#     &\text{subject to} \qquad
#     \begin{alignedat}[t]{2}
#         -\Delta u &= f \quad &&\text{ in } \Omega,\\
#         u &= 0 \quad &&\text{ on } \Gamma.
#     \end{alignedat}
# \end{align}
# $$
#
# For the initial domain, we use the unit disc
# $\Omega = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^2 \,\mid\, \lvert\lvert x \rvert\rvert_2 < 1 \}$ and the
# right-hand side $f$ is given by
#
# $$
# f(x) = 2.5 \left( x_1 + 0.4 - x_2^2 \right)^2 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1.
# $$
#
# ## Implementation
#
# The complete python code can be found in the file {download}`demo_shape_solver.py
# </../../demos/documented/cashocs_as_solver/shape_solver/demo_shape_solver.py>`
# and the corresponding config can be found in {download}`config.ini
# </../../demos/documented/cashocs_as_solver/shape_solver/config.ini>`.
#
# ### Recapitulation of {ref}`demo_shape_poisson`
#
# Analogously to {ref}`demo_control_solver`, the code we use in case cashocs is treated
# as a solver only is identical to the one of {ref}`demo_shape_poisson` up to the
# definition of the optimization problem. For the sake of completeness we recall the
# corresponding code in the following

# +
from fenics import *

import cashocs

config = cashocs.load_config("./config.ini")

mesh, subdomains, boundaries, dx, ds, dS = cashocs.import_mesh("./mesh/mesh.xdmf")

V = FunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 1)
u = Function(V)
p = Function(V)

x = SpatialCoordinate(mesh)
f = 2.5 * pow(x[0] + 0.4 - pow(x[1], 2), 2) + pow(x[0], 2) + pow(x[1], 2) - 1

e = inner(grad(u), grad(p)) * dx - f * p * dx
bcs = DirichletBC(V, Constant(0), boundaries, 1)

J = cashocs.IntegralFunctional(u * dx)

sop = cashocs.ShapeOptimizationProblem(e, bcs, J, u, p, boundaries, config=config)

# ### Supplying Custom Adjoint Systems and Shape Derivatives
#
# Now, our goal is to use custom UFL forms for the adjoint system and shape derivative.
# Note, that the adjoint system for the considered optimization problem is given by
#
# $$
# \begin{alignedat}{2}
#     - \Delta p &= 1 \quad &&\text{ in } \Omega, \\
#     p &= 0 \quad &&\text{ on } \Gamma,
# \end{alignedat}
# $$
#
# and the corresponding shape derivative is given by
#
# $$
# dJ(\Omega)[\mathcal{V}] =
# \int_{\Omega} \text{div}\left( \mathcal{V} \right) u \text{ d}x
# + \int_{\Omega} \left( \left( \text{div}(\mathcal{V})I
# - 2 \varepsilon(\mathcal{V}) \right) \nabla u \right) \cdot \nabla p \text{ d}x
# + \int_{\Omega} \text{div}\left( f \mathcal{V} \right) p \text{ d}x,
# $$
#
# where $\varepsilon(\mathcal{V})$ is the symmetric part of the gradient of
# $\mathcal{V}$, given by $\varepsilon(\mathcal{V})
# = \frac{1}{2} \left( D\mathcal{V} + D\mathcal{V}^\top \right)$.
# For details, we refer the reader to, e.g., [Delfour and Zolesio -
# Shapes and Geometries](https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9780898719826).
#
# To supply these weak forms to cashocs, we can use the following code. For the
# shape derivative, we write

# +
def eps(u):
    return Constant(0.5) * (grad(u) + grad(u).T)


vector_field = sop.get_vector_field()
dJ = (
    div(vector_field) * u * dx
    - inner(
        (div(vector_field) * Identity(2) - 2 * eps(vector_field)) * grad(u),
        grad(p),
    )
    * dx
    + div(f * vector_field) * p * dx
)
# -

# Note, that we have to call the
# {py:meth}`get_vector_field <cashocs.ShapeOptimizationProblem.get_vector_field>` method
# which returns the UFL object corresponding to $\mathcal{V}$ and which is to be used
# at its place.
#
# ::::{hint}
# Alternatively, one could define the variable {python}`vector_field` as follows
# :::python
# space = VectorFunctionSpace(mesh, 'CG', 1)
# vector_field = TestFunction(space)
# :::
#
# which would yield identical results. However, the shorthand via the
# {py:meth}`get_vector_field <cashocs.ShapeOptimizationProblem.get_vector_field>`
# is more convenient, as one does not have to remember to define the correct function
# space first.
# ::::
#
# For the adjoint system, the procedure is exactly the same as in
# {ref}`demo_control_solver` and we have the following code

adjoint_form = inner(grad(p), grad(TestFunction(V))) * dx - TestFunction(V) * dx
adjoint_bcs = bcs

# Again, the format is analogous to the format of the state system, but now we have to
# specify a {py:class}`fenics.TestFunction` object for the adjoint equation.
#
# Finally, the weak forms are supplied to cashocs with the line

sop.supply_custom_forms(dJ, adjoint_form, adjoint_bcs)

# and the optimization problem is solved with

sop.solve()

# :::{note}
# One can also specify either the adjoint system or the shape derivative of the cost
# functional, using the methods {py:meth}`supply_adjoint_forms
# <cashocs.ShapeOptimizationProblem.supply_adjoint_forms>` or
# {py:meth}`supply_derivatives
# <cashocs.ShapeOptimizationProblem.supply_shape_derivative>`.
# However, this is potentially dangerous, due to the following. The adjoint system
# is a linear system, and there is no fixed convention for the sign of the adjoint
# state. Hence, supplying, e.g., only the adjoint system, might not be compatible with
# the derivative of the cost functional which cashocs computes. In effect, the sign
# is specified by the choice of adding or subtracting the PDE constraint from the
# cost functional for the definition of a Lagrangian function, which is used to
# determine the adjoint system and derivative. cashocs internally uses the convention
# that the PDE constraint is added, so that, internally, it computes not the adjoint
# state $p$ as defined by the equations given above, but $-p$ instead.
# Hence, it is recommended to either specify all respective quantities with the
# {py:meth}`supply_custom_forms <cashocs.ShapeOptimizationProblem.supply_custom_forms>`
# method.

# also have to be specified as ordered lists, just as explained for optimal control
# problems in {ref}`demo_multiple_variables`.
