# # Control Constraints
#
# ## Problem Formulation
#
# In this demo, we take a deeper look at how control constraints can be treated in
# cashocs. To do so, we investigate the same problem as in {ref}`demo_poisson`, but
# now with the addition of box constraints for the control variable. This problem
# reads
#
# $$
# \begin{align}
#     &\min\; J(y,u) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Omega} \left( y - y_d \right)^2 \text{ d}x
#     + \frac{\alpha}{2} \int_{\Omega} u^2 \text{ d}x \\
#     &\text{ subject to } \qquad
#     \begin{alignedat}[t]{2}
#         -\Delta y &= u \quad &&\text{ in } \Omega,\\
#         y &= 0 \quad &&\text{ on } \Gamma, \\
#         u_a \leq u &\leq u_b \quad &&\text{ in } \Omega
#     \end{alignedat}
# \end{align}
# $$

# (see, e.g., [Tr√∂ltzsch - Optimal Control of Partial Differential Equations](
# https://doi.org/10.1090/gsm/112) or [Hinze, Pinnau, Ulbrich, and Ulbrich -
# Optimization with PDE constraints](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-8839-1).
#
# Here, the functions $u_a$ and $u_b$ are $L^\infty(\Omega)$ functions. As before, we
# consider as domain the unit square, i.e., $\Omega = (0, 1)^2$.
#
# ## Implementation
#
# The complete python code can be found in the file {download}`demo_box_constraints.py
# </../../demos/documented/optimal_control/box_constraints/demo_box_constraints.py>`
# and the corresponding config can be found in {download}`config.ini
# </../../demos/documented/optimal_control/box_constraints/config.ini>`.
#
# ### Initialization
#
# The beginning of the script is completely identical to the
# one of {ref}`previous example <demo_poisson>`, so we only restate the corresponding
# code in the following

# +
from fenics import *

import cashocs

config = cashocs.load_config("config.ini")

mesh, subdomains, boundaries, dx, ds, dS = cashocs.regular_mesh(20)
V = FunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 1)

y = Function(V)
p = Function(V)
u = Function(V)

e = inner(grad(y), grad(p)) * dx - u * p * dx

bcs = cashocs.create_dirichlet_bcs(V, Constant(0), boundaries, [1, 2, 3, 4])

y_d = Expression("sin(2*pi*x[0])*sin(2*pi*x[1])", degree=1)
alpha = 1e-6
J = cashocs.IntegralFunctional(
    Constant(0.5) * (y - y_d) * (y - y_d) * dx + Constant(0.5 * alpha) * u * u * dx
)

# ### Definition of the Control Constraints
#
# Here, we have nearly everything at hand to define the optimal control problem, the
# only missing ingredient are the box constraints, which we define now. For the purposes
# of this example, we consider a linear (in the x-direction) corridor for these
# constraints, as it highlights the capabilities of cashocs. Hence, we define the lower
# and upper bounds via

u_a = interpolate(Expression("50*(x[0]-1)", degree=1), V)
u_b = interpolate(Expression("50*x[0]", degree=1), V)

# which just corresponds to two functions, generated from {py:class}`fenics.Expression`
# objects via {py:func}`fenics.interpolate`. These are then put into the list
# {python}`cc`, which models the control constraints, i.e.,

cc = [u_a, u_b]

# ::::{note}
# As an alternative way of specifying the box constraints, one can also use regular
# float or int objects, in case that they are constant. For example, the constraint that
# we only want to consider positive value for u, i.e., $0 \leq u \leq +\infty$ can be
# realized via
#
# :::python
# u_a = 0
# u_b = float('inf')
# cc = [u_a, u_b]
# :::
#
# and completely analogous with {python}`float('-inf')` for no constraint on the lower
# bound. Moreover, note that the specification of using either constant {python}`float`
# values and {py:class}`fenics.Function` objects can be mixed arbitrarily, so that one
# can, e.g., specify a constant value for the upper boundary and use a
# {py:class}`fenics.Function` on the lower one.
# ::::
#
# ### Setup of the optimization problem and its solution
#
# Now, we can set up the optimal control problem as we did before, using the additional
# keyword argument {python}`control_constraints` into which we put the list
# {python}`cc`, and then solve it via the {py:meth}`ocp.solve()
# <cashocs.OptimalControlProblem.solve>` method

ocp = cashocs.OptimalControlProblem(
    e, bcs, J, y, u, p, config=config, control_constraints=cc
)
ocp.solve()

# To check that the box constraints are actually satisfied by our solution, we perform
# an assertion

# +
import numpy as np

assert np.alltrue(u_a.vector()[:] <= u.vector()[:]) and np.alltrue(
    u.vector()[:] <= u_b.vector()[:]
)
# -

# which shows that they are indeed satisfied. The visualization is carried out
# analogously to before, via

# +
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))

plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
fig = plot(u)
plt.colorbar(fig, fraction=0.046, pad=0.04)
plt.title("Control variable u")

plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
fig = plot(y)
plt.colorbar(fig, fraction=0.046, pad=0.04)
plt.title("State variable y")

plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
fig = plot(y_d, mesh=mesh)
plt.colorbar(fig, fraction=0.046, pad=0.04)
plt.title("Desired state y_d")

plt.tight_layout()
# plt.savefig('./img_box_constraints.png', dpi=150, bbox_inches='tight')
# -

# and should yield the following output
# ![](/../../demos/documented/optimal_control/box_constraints/img_box_constraints.png)
