# # Coupled Problems - Picard Iteration
#
# ## Problem Formulation
#
# In this demo we show how cashocs can be used with a coupled PDE constraint. For this,
# we consider an iterative approach, whereas we investigated a monolithic approach in
# {ref}`demo_monolithic_problems`.
#
# As model example, we consider the following problem
#
# $$
# \begin{align}
#     &\min\; J((y,z),(u,v)) = \frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega \left( y - y_d \right)^2
#     \text{ d}x + \frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega \left( z - z_d \right)^2 \text{ d}x
#     + \frac{\alpha}{2} \int_\Omega u^2 \text{ d}x + \frac{\beta}{2} \int_\Omega v^2
#     \text{ d}x \\
#     &\text{ subject to }\qquad
#     \begin{alignedat}[t]{2}
#         -\Delta y + z &= u \quad &&\text{ in } \Omega, \\
#         y &= 0 \quad &&\text{ on } \Gamma,\\
#         -\Delta z + y &= v \quad &&\text{ in } \Omega,\\
#         z &= 0 \quad &&\text{ on } \Gamma.
#     \end{alignedat}
# \end{align}
# $$
#
# Again, the system is two-way coupled. To solve it, we now employ a Picard iteration.
# Therefore, the two PDEs are solved subsequently, where the variables are frozen in
# between: At the beginning the first PDE is solved for $y$, with $z$ being fixed.
# Afterwards, the second PDE is solved for $z$ with $y$ fixed. This is then repeated
# until convergence is reached.
#
# :::{note}
# There is, however, no a-priori guarantee that the Picard iteration converges
# for a particular problem, unless a careful analysis is carried out by the user.
# Still, it is an important tool, which also often works well in practice.
# :::
#
# ## Implementation
#
# The complete python code can be found in the file {download}`demo_picard_iteration.py
# </../../demos/documented/optimal_control/picard_iteration/demo_picard_iteration.py>`
# and the corresponding config can be found in {download}`config.ini
# </../../demos/documented/optimal_control/picard_iteration/config.ini>`.
#
# ### Initialization
#
# The setup is as in {ref}`demo_poisson`

# +
from fenics import *

import cashocs

config = cashocs.load_config("config.ini")
mesh, subdomains, boundaries, dx, ds, dS = cashocs.regular_mesh(50)
V = FunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 1)
# -

# However, compared to the previous examples, there is a major change in the config
# file. As we want to use the Picard iteration as solver for the state PDEs, we now
# specify
# :::python
# picard_iteration = True
# :::
#
# see {download}`config.ini
# </../../demos/documented/optimal_control/picard_iteration/config.ini>`.
#
# ### Definition of the state system
#
# The definition of the state system follows the same ideas as introduced in
# {ref}`demo_multiple_variables`: We define both state equations through their
# components, and then gather them in lists, which are passed to the
# {py:class}`OptimalControlProblem <cashocs.OptimalControlProblem>`.
# The state and adjoint variables are defined via

y = Function(V)
p = Function(V)
z = Function(V)
q = Function(V)

# The control variables are defined as

u = Function(V)
v = Function(V)

# Next, we define the state system, using the weak forms from
# {ref}`demo_monolithic_problems`

# +
e_y = inner(grad(y), grad(p)) * dx + z * p * dx - u * p * dx
bcs_y = cashocs.create_dirichlet_bcs(V, Constant(0), boundaries, [1, 2, 3, 4])

e_z = inner(grad(z), grad(q)) * dx + y * q * dx - v * q * dx
bcs_z = cashocs.create_dirichlet_bcs(V, Constant(0), boundaries, [1, 2, 3, 4])
# -

# Finally, we use the same procedure as in {ref}`demo_multiple_variables`, and
# put everything into (ordered) lists

# +
states = [y, z]
adjoints = [p, q]
controls = [u, v]

e = [e_y, e_z]
bcs = [bcs_y, bcs_z]
# -

# ### Definition of the optimization problem
#
# The cost functional is defined as in {ref}`demo_monolithic_problems`, the only
# difference is that {python}`y` and {python}`z` now are {py:class}`fenics.Function` objects, whereas
# they were generated with the {py:func}`fenics.split` command previously

y_d = Expression("sin(2*pi*x[0])*sin(2*pi*x[1])", degree=1)
z_d = Expression("sin(4*pi*x[0])*sin(4*pi*x[1])", degree=1)
alpha = 1e-6
beta = 1e-6
J = cashocs.IntegralFunctional(
    Constant(0.5) * (y - y_d) * (y - y_d) * dx
    + Constant(0.5) * (z - z_d) * (z - z_d) * dx
    + Constant(0.5 * alpha) * u * u * dx
    + Constant(0.5 * beta) * v * v * dx
)

# Finally, we set up the optimization problem and solve it

optimization_problem = cashocs.OptimalControlProblem(
    e, bcs, J, states, controls, adjoints, config=config
)
optimization_problem.solve()

# We visualize the results with the code

# ![](/../../demos/documented/optimal_control/picard_iteration/img_picard_iteration.png)
#
# :::{note}
# Comparing the output (especially in the early iterations) between the monlithic and Picard apporach
# we observe that both methods yield essentially the same results (up to machine precision). This validates
# the Picard approach.
#
# However, one should note that for this example, the Picard approach takes
# significantly longer to compute the optimizer. This is due to the fact that the
# individual PDEs have to be solved several times, whereas in the monolithic approach
# the state system is (slightly) larger, but has to be solved less often. However, the
# monolithic approach needs significantly more memory, so that the Picard iteration
# becomes feasible for very large problems. Further, the convergence properties of the
# Picard iteration are better, so that it may converge even when the monolithic approach
# fails.
