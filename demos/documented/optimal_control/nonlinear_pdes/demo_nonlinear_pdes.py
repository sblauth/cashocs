# # Optimal Control with Nonlinear PDE Constraints
#
# ## Problem Formulation
#
# In this demo, we take a look at the case of nonlinear PDE constraints for optimization
# problems. As a model problem, we consider
#
# $$
# \begin{align}
#     &\min\; J(y,u) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Omega} \left( y - y_d \right)^2 \text{ d}x
#     + \frac{\alpha}{2} \int_{\Omega} u^2 \text{ d}x \\
#     &\text{ subject to } \qquad
#     \begin{alignedat}[t]{2}
#         -\Delta y + c y^3 &= u \quad &&\text{ in } \Omega,\\
#         y &= 0 \quad &&\text{ on } \Gamma.
#     \end{alignedat}
# \end{align}
# $$
#
# As this problem has a nonlinear PDE as state constraint, we have to modify the config
# file slightly. In particular, in the Section
# {ref}`StateSystem <config_ocp_state_system>` we have to write
# :::python
# is_linear = False
# :::
#
# Note, that {ini}`is_linear = False` works for any problem, as linear equations are
# just a special case of nonlinear ones, and the corresponding nonlinear solver
# converges in a single iteration for these. However, in the opposite case, FEniCS will
# raise an error, so that an actually nonlinear equation cannot be solved using
# {ini}`is_linear = True`. Also, we briefly recall from {ref}`config_optimal_control`,
# that the default behavior is {ini}`is_linear = False`, so that this is not an issue.
#
# ## Implementation
#
# The complete python code can be found in the file {download}`demo_nonlinear_pdes.py
# </../../demos/documented/optimal_control/nonlinear_pdes/demo_nonlinear_pdes.py>`
# and the corresponding config can be found in {download}`config.ini
# </../../demos/documented/optimal_control/nonlinear_pdes/config.ini>`.
#
# ### Initialization
#
# Thanks to the high level interface for implementing weak formulations, this problem
# is tackled almost as easily as the one in {ref}`demo_poisson`. In particular, the
# entire initialization, up to the definition of the weak form of the PDE constraint,
# is identical, and we have

# +
from fenics import *

import cashocs

config = cashocs.load_config("config.ini")
mesh, subdomains, boundaries, dx, ds, dS = cashocs.regular_mesh(25)
V = FunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 1)

y = Function(V)
p = Function(V)
u = Function(V)
# -

# For the definition of the state constraints, we use essentially the same syntax as
# we would use for the problem in FEniCS, i.e., we write

c = Constant(1e2)
e = inner(grad(y), grad(p)) * dx + c * pow(y, 3) * p * dx - u * p * dx

# :::{note}
# In particular, the only difference between the cashocs implementation of this weak
# form and the FEniCS one is that, as before, we use {py:class}`fenics.Function` objects
# for both the state and adjoint variables, whereas we would use
# {py:class}`fenics.Function` objects for the state, and {py:class}`fenics.TestFunction`
# for the adjoint variable, which would actually play the role of the test function.
# Other than that, the syntax is, again, identical to the one of FEniCS.
# :::
#
# Finally, the boundary conditions are defined as before

bcs = cashocs.create_dirichlet_bcs(V, Constant(0), boundaries, [1, 2, 3, 4])

# ### Solution of the optimization problem
#
# To define and solve the optimization problem, we now proceed exactly as in
# {ref}`demo_poisson`, and use

# +
y_d = Expression("sin(2*pi*x[0])*sin(2*pi*x[1])", degree=1)
alpha = 1e-6
J = cashocs.IntegralFunctional(
    Constant(0.5) * (y - y_d) * (y - y_d) * dx + Constant(0.5 * alpha) * u * u * dx
)

ocp = cashocs.OptimalControlProblem(e, bcs, J, y, u, p, config=config)
ocp.solve()
# -

# We visualize the results with the lines
