# # Treatment of additional constraints
#
# ## Problem Formulation
#
# In this demo we investigate cashocs for solving PDE constrained optimization problems
# with additional constraints. To do so, we investigate the "mother problem" of PDE
# constrained optimization, i.e.,
#
# $$
# \begin{align}
#     &\min\; J(y,u) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Omega} \left( y - y_d \right)^2
#     \text{ d}x + \frac{\alpha}{2} \int_{\Omega} u^2 \text{ d}x \\
#     &\text{ subject to } \qquad
#     \begin{alignedat}[t]{2}
#         -\Delta y &= u \quad &&\text{ in } \Omega,\\
#         y &= 0 \quad &&\text{ on } \Gamma, \\
#         y &= c_{b,l} \quad &&\text{ on } \Omega_{b,l},\\
#         \int_{\Omega_{b,r}} y^2 \text{ d}x &= c_{b,r},\\
#         \int_{\Omega_{t,l}} y \text{ d}x &\geq c_{t,l},\\
#         y &\leq c_{t,r} \quad &&\text{ in } \Omega_{t,r}.
#     \end{alignedat}
# \end{align}
# $$
#
# Here, we have four additional constraints, each for one quarter of the unit square
# $\Omega = (0,1)^2$, indicated by $(b,l)$ for bottom left, $(b,r)$ for
# bottom right, $(t,l)$ for top left, and $(t,r)$ for top right.
#
# In the following, we will describe how to solve this problem
# using cashocs.
#
# ## Implementation
#
# The complete python code can be found in the file {download}`demo_constraints.py
# </../../demos/documented/optimal_control/constraints/demo_constraints.py>` and the
# corresponding config can be found in {download}`config.ini
# </../../demos/documented/optimal_control/constraints/config.ini>`.
#
# ### Initialization
#
# The beginning of the program is nearly the same as for {ref}`demo_poisson`

import cashocs

cashocs.set_log_level(cashocs.LogLevel.INFO)
config = cashocs.load_config("config.ini")

# ### Definition of the additional constraints
#
# In the following, we define the additional constraints we want to consider together
# with the PDE constraint. In this case, we only have state constraints, but additional
# constraints on the control variables can be treated completely analogously.
#
# First, we define the four quarters of the unit square

bottom_left = Expression("(x[0] <= 0.5) && (x[1] <= 0.5) ? 1.0 : 0.0", degree=0)
bottom_right = Expression("(x[0] >= 0.5) && (x[1] <= 0.5) ? 1.0 : 0.0", degree=0)
top_left = Expression("(x[0] <= 0.5) && (x[1] >= 0.5) ? 1.0 : 0.0", degree=0)
top_right = Expression("(x[0] >= 0.5) && (x[1] >= 0.5) ? 1.0 : 0.0", degree=0)

# The four Expressions above are indicator functions for the respective quarters, which
# allows us to implement the constraints easily.
#
# Next, we define the pointwise equality constraint we have on the lower left quarter.
# To do so, we use {py:class}`cashocs.EqualityConstraint` as follows

pointwise_equality_constraint = cashocs.EqualityConstraint(
    bottom_left * y, 0.0, measure=dx
)

# Here, the first argument is the left-hand side of the equality constraint, namely the
# indicator function for the lower left quarter multiplied by the state variable y.
# The next argument is the right-hand side of the equality constraint, i.e.,
# $c_{b,l}$ which we choose as 0 in this example. Finally, the keyword argument
# {python}`measure` is used to specify the integration measure that should be used to
# define where the constraint is given. Typical examples are a volume measure (`dx`, as
# it is the case here) or surface measure (`ds`, which could be used if we wanted to
# pose the constraint only on the boundary).
#
# Let's move on to the next constraint. Again, we have an equality constraint, but now
# it is a scalar value which is constrained, and its given by the integral over some
# integrand. This is the general form in which cashocs can deal with such scalar
# constraints. Let's see how we can define this constraint in cashocs

integral_equality_constraint = cashocs.EqualityConstraint(
    bottom_right * pow(y, 2) * dx, 0.01
)

# Here, we again use the {py:class}`cashocs.EqualityConstraint` class, as before. The
# difference is that now, the first argument is the UFL form of the integrand, in this
# case $y^2$ multiplied by the indicator function of the bottom right quarter, i.e.,
# the left-hand side of the constraint. The second and final argument for this
# constraint is right-hand side of the constraint, i.e., $c_{b,r}$, which we choose as
# {python}`0.01` in this example.
#
# Let's move on to the interesting case of inequality constraints. Let us first consider
# a setting similar to before, where the constraint's left-hand side is given by an
# integral over some integrand. We define this integral inequality constraint via the
# {py:class}`cashocs.InequalityConstraint` class

integral_inequality_constraint = cashocs.InequalityConstraint(
    top_left * y * dx, lower_bound=-0.025
)

# Here, as before, the first argument is the left-hand side of the constraint, i.e., the
# UFL form of the integrand, in this case $y$ times the indicator function of the top
# left quarter, which is to be integrated over the measure {python}`dx`. The second
# argument {python}`lower_bound = -0.025` specifies the lower bound for this inequality
# constraint, that means, that $c_{t,l} = -0.025$ in our case.
#
# Finally, let us take a look at the case of pointwise inequality constraint. This is,
# as before, implemented via the {py:class}`cashocs.InequalityConstraint` class

pointwise_inequality_constraint = cashocs.InequalityConstraint(
    top_right * y, upper_bound=0.25, measure=dx
)

# Here, again the first argument is the function on the left-hand side of the
# constraint, i.e., $y$ times the indicator function of the top right quarter. The
# second argument, {python}`upper_bound=0.25`, defines the right-hand side of the
# constraint, i.e., we choose $c_{t,r} = 0.25$. Finally, as for the pointwise equality
# constraint, we specify the integration measure for which the constraint is posed, in
# our case {python}`measure=dx`, as we consider the constraint pointwise in the domain
# $\Omega$.
#
# :::{note}
# For bilateral inequality constraints we can use both keyword arguments
# {python}`upper_bound` and {python}`lower_bound` to define both bounds for the
# constraint.
# :::
#
# As is usual in cashocs, once we have defined multiple constraints, we gather them into
# a list to pass them to the optimization routines

constraints = [
    pointwise_equality_constraint,
    integral_equality_constraint,
    integral_inequality_constraint,
    pointwise_inequality_constraint,
]

# Finally, we define the optimization problem. As we deal with additional constraints,
# we do not use a {py:class}`cashocs.OptimalControlProblem`, but use a
# {py:class}`cashocs.ConstrainedOptimalControlProblem`, which can be used to deal with
# these additional constaints. As usual, we can solve the problem with its
# {py:meth}`solve <cashocs.ConstrainedOptimalControlProblem.solve>` method

problem = cashocs.ConstrainedOptimalControlProblem(
    e, bcs, J, y, u, p, constraints, config
)
problem.solve(method="AL")

# :::{note}
# To be able to treat (nearly) arbitrary types of constraints, cashocs regularizes
# these using either an augmented Lagrangian method or a quadratic penalty method.
# Which method is used can be specified via the keyword argument {python}`method`, which
# is chosen to be an augmented Lagrangian method (`'AL'`) in this demo.

#
# Finally, we visualize the result with the following code
