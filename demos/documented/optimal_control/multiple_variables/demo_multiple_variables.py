# # Using Multiple Variables and PDEs
#
# ## Problem Formulation
#
# In this demo we show how cashocs can be used to treat multiple
# state equations as constraint. Additionally, this also highlights
# how the case of multiple controls can be treated. As model example, we consider the
# following problem
#
# $$
# \begin{align}
#     &\min\; J((y,z), (u,v)) = \frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega \left( y - y_d \right) \text{ d}x + \frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega \left( z - z_d \right) \text{ d}x + \frac{\alpha}{2} \int_\Omega u^2 \text{ d}x + \frac{\beta}{2} \int_\Omega v^2 \text{ d}x \\
#     &\text{ subject to } \qquad
#     \begin{alignedat}[t]{2}
#         -\Delta y &= u \quad &&\text{ in } \Omega, \\
#         y &= 0 \quad &&\text{ on } \Gamma,\\
#         -\Delta z - y &= v \quad &&\text{ in } \Omega, \\
#         z &= 0 \quad &&\text{ on } \Gamma.
#     \end{alignedat}
# \end{align}
# $$
#
# For the sake of simplicity, we restrict this investigation to
# homogeneous boundary conditions as well as to a very simple one way
# coupling. More complex problems (using e.g. Neumann control or more
# difficult couplings) are straightforward to implement.
#
# In contrast to the previous examples, in the case where we have multiple state
# equations, which are either decoupled or only one-way coupled, the corresponding state
# equations are solved one after the other so that every input related to the state and
# adjoint variables has to be put into a ordered list, so that they can be treated
# properly, as is explained in the following.
#
# ## Implementation
#
# The complete python code can be found in the file {download}`demo_multiple_variables.py
# </../../demos/documented/optimal_control/multiple_variables/demo_multiple_variables.py>`
# and the corresponding config can be found in {download}`config.ini
# </../../demos/documented/optimal_control/multiple_variables/config.ini>`.
#
# ### Initialization
#
# The initial setup is identical to the previous cases (see, {ref}`demo_poisson`), where
# we again use

# +
from fenics import *

import cashocs

config = cashocs.load_config("config.ini")
mesh, subdomains, boundaries, dx, ds, dS = cashocs.regular_mesh(50)
V = FunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 1)
# -

# which defines the geometry and the function space.
#
# ### Definition of the problems
#
# We now first define the state equation corresponding to the state $y$. This is done in
# analogy to {ref}`demo_poisson`

y = Function(V)
p = Function(V)
u = Function(V)
e_y = inner(grad(y), grad(p)) * dx - u * p * dx
bcs_y = cashocs.create_dirichlet_bcs(V, Constant(0), boundaries, [1, 2, 3, 4])

# Similarly to before, {python}`p` is the adjoint state corresponding to {python}`y`.
#
# Next, we define the second state equation (which is for the state $z$) via

z = Function(V)
q = Function(V)
v = Function(V)
e_z = inner(grad(z), grad(q)) * dx - (y + v) * q * dx
bcs_z = cashocs.create_dirichlet_bcs(V, Constant(0), boundaries, [1, 2, 3, 4])

# Here, {python}`q` is the adjoint state corresponding to {python}`z`.
#
# In order to treat this one-way coupled with cashocs, we now have to specify what
# the state, adjoint, and control variables are. This is done by putting the
# corresponding {py:class}`fenics.Function` objects into ordered lists

states = [y, z]
adjoints = [p, q]
controls = [u, v]

# To define the corresponding state system, the state equations and Dirichlet boundary
# conditions also have to be put into an ordered list, i.e.,

e = [e_y, e_z]
bcs_list = [bcs_y, bcs_z]

# :::{note}
# It is important, that the ordering of the state and adjoint variables, as well
# as the state equations and boundary conditions is in the same way. This means,
# that {python}`e[i]` is the state equation for {python}`state[i]`, which is
# supplemented with Dirichlet boundary conditions defined in {python}`bcs_list[i]`, and
# has a corresponding adjoint state {python}`adjoints[i]`, for all {python}`i`. In
# analogy, the same holds true for the control variables, the scalar product of the
# control space, and the control constraints, i.e., {python}`controls[j]`,
# {python}`riesz_scalar_products[j]`, and {python}`control_constraints[j]` all have to
# belong to the same control variable.
# :::
#
# Note that the control variables are completely independent of the state
# and adjoint ones, so that the relative ordering between these objects does
# not matter.
#
# ### Defintion of the cost functional and optimization problem
#
# For the optimization problem we now define the cost functional via

y_d = Expression("sin(2*pi*x[0])*sin(2*pi*x[1])", degree=1)
z_d = Expression("sin(4*pi*x[0])*sin(4*pi*x[1])", degree=1)
alpha = 1e-6
beta = 1e-4
J = cashocs.IntegralFunctional(
    Constant(0.5) * (y - y_d) * (y - y_d) * dx
    + Constant(0.5) * (z - z_d) * (z - z_d) * dx
    + Constant(0.5 * alpha) * u * u * dx
    + Constant(0.5 * beta) * v * v * dx
)

# This setup is sufficient to now define the optimal control problem and solve it, via

ocp = cashocs.OptimalControlProblem(
    e, bcs_list, J, states, controls, adjoints, config=config
)
ocp.solve()

# We visualize the results of the problem with the code

# ![](/../../demos/documented/optimal_control/multiple_variables/img_multiple_variables.png)
#
# :::{note}
# Note, that the error between $z$ and $z_d$ is significantly larger
# that the error between $y$ and $y_d$. This is due to the fact that
# we use a different regularization parameter for the controls $u$ and $v$.
# For the former, which only acts on $y$, we have a regularization parameter
# of {python}`alpha = 1e-6`, and for the latter we have {python}`beta = 1e-4`. Hence,
# $v$ is penalized higher for being large, so that also $z$ is (significantly)
# smaller than $z_d$.
# :::
#
# ::::{hint}
# Note, that for the case that we consider control constraints (see
# {ref}`demo_box_constraints`) or different Hilbert spaces, e.g., for boundary control
# (see {ref}`demo_neumann_control`), the corresponding control constraints have also to
# be put into a joint list, i.e.,
# :::python
# cc_u = [u_a, u_b]
# cc_v = [v_a, v_b]
# cc = [cc_u, cc_v]
# :::
#
# and the corresponding scalar products have to be treated analogously, i.e.,
# :::python
# scalar_product_u = TrialFunction(V)*TestFunction(V)*dx
# scalar_product_v = TrialFunction(V)*TestFunction(V)*dx
# scalar_products = [scalar_product_u, scalar_produt_v]
# :::
# ::::
#
# In summary, to treat multiple (control or state) variables, the
# corresponding objects simply have to placed into ordered lists which
# are then passed to the {py:class}`OptimalControlProblem <cashocs.OptimalControlProblem>`
# instead of the "single" objects as in the previous examples. Note, that each
# individual object of these lists is allowed to be from a different function space,
# and hence, this enables different discretizations of state and adjoint systems.
