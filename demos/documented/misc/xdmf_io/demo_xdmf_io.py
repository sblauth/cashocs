# # Writing and Reading XDMF Files
#
# cashocs can be used to store XDMF files of the current states, adjoints, and
# gradients. This has great use for visualization and post-processing. The output of
# these files is usually controlled via the configuration file, see the corresponding
# documentation for {ref}`optimal control <config_ocp_output>` and {ref}`shape
# optimization <config_shape_output>`.
#
# In this tutorial, we show how cashocs can be used to store these files, but also how
# these files can be used to read the solutions into python again, so that a
# post-processing can also occur inside python, not only with paraview. To do so, we
# consider the same problem as in {ref}`demo_shape_poisson`, which we do not again
# recall here.
#
# ## Implementation
#
# The complete python code can be found in the file {download}`demo_xdmf_io.py
# </../../demos/documented/misc/xdmf_io/demo_xdmf_io.py>`,
# and the corresponding config can be found in {download}`config.ini
# </../../demos/documented/misc/xdmf_io/config.ini>`.
#
# ### Automatically writing XDMF files
#
# Let us start our discussion with solving the shape optimization problem, where we use
# code in complete analogy to {ref}`demo_shape_poisson`. The only difference lies in the
# config file, where we use the following
#
# :::ini
# [Output]
# save_state = True
# save_adjoint = True
# save_gradient = True
# :::
#
# This means, that when we now use cashocs to solve the problem, the output is stored to
# a directory, which is specified in the {ini}`result_dir` of the Output Section of the
# config file. As we have not specified a directory, the files will be created in the
# default location `./results`, and the XDMF files will be stored in `./results/xdmf`.
#
# The code for solving the problem is as follows

from fenics import *

# +
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import cashocs

config = cashocs.load_config("./config.ini")
mesh, subdomains, boundaries, dx, ds, dS = cashocs.import_mesh("./mesh/mesh.xdmf")

V = FunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 1)
u = Function(V)
p = Function(V)

x = SpatialCoordinate(mesh)
f = 2.5 * pow(x[0] + 0.4 - pow(x[1], 2), 2) + pow(x[0], 2) + pow(x[1], 2) - 1

e = inner(grad(u), grad(p)) * dx - f * p * dx
bcs = DirichletBC(V, Constant(0), boundaries, 1)

J = cashocs.IntegralFunctional(u * dx)

sop = cashocs.ShapeOptimizationProblem(e, bcs, J, u, p, boundaries, config=config)
sop.solve()
# -

# After we have run this code, we can see that now a directory `./results` exists and
# that the XDMF files are located in `./results/xdmf`, as expected.
#
# ### Reading the XDMF files back into python
#
# To read the stored functions back into python, we can make use of the function
# {py:func}`cashocs.io.read_function_from_xdmf`, which works as follows

u_init = cashocs.io.read_function_from_xdmf(
    "./results/xdmf/state_0.xdmf", "state_0", "CG", 1, step=0
)

# The function works as follows. In the first argument, we have to specify the location
# of the file which we want to read. The second argument is the name of the function.
# Cashocs names these functions depending on whether they are a state, adjoint, or
# control variable or whether they are gradient-type functions. State variables are
# named {python}`'state_i'` where `i` denotes the index of the state variable, in case
# multiple ones are used. The same is true for adjoint variables, control variables, and
# gradients, where the names are {python}`'adjoint_i'`, {python}`'control_i'`, and
# {python}`'gradient_i'` or {python}`'shape_gradient_i'`.
#
# :::{hint}
# One can easily deduce the name of a variable stored in an XDMF file written by
# cashocs. If the file is named {python}`'name_i.xdmf'`, the name of the function is
# {python}`'name_i'`. For example, when using {ref}`multiple variables
# <demo_multiple_variables>` or problems with {ref}`mixed spaces
# <demo_monolithic_problems>`, the outputs could, e.g., have the names
# {python}`'state_1_2.xdmf'`, so that the corresponding name would be
# {python}`'state_1_2'`
# :::
#
# :::{warning}
# The only exception to the above rule are shape gradients. There, the files are called
# {python}`'shape_gradient.xdmf'`, but the name of the functions is analogous to the
# one for optimal control, i.e., it is always {python}`'gradient_0'`.
# :::
#
# The third parameter for {py:func}`cashocs.io.read_function_from_xdmf` is the name of
# the finite element space, which was used when initially creating the function space
# for the function. As we used linear Lagrange elements, we have to use {python}`'CG'`
# here. The fourth argument specifies the degree of the finite element, which is 1 in
# this case. Finally, the keyword argument {python}`step` is used to indicate at which
# iteration we would like to read the function. For this example we have chosen
# {python}`step=0`, so that we read the state variable at the initial iteration.
#
# Let us now also read the state variable at the last iteration, which we do with the
# line

u_final = cashocs.io.read_function_from_xdmf(
    "./results/xdmf/state_0.xdmf", "state_0", "CG", 1, step=11
)

# Let us now compare these functions in python, with the help of matplotlib.

# +
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plot(u_init)
plt.title("State variable at initial iteration")

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plot(u_final)
plt.title("State variable at final iteration")

plt.tight_layout()
# plt.savefig("./img_states.png", dpi=150, bbox_inches="tight")
# -

# The result looks as follows
# ![](/../../demos/documented/misc/xdmf_io/img_states.png)
#
# Here, we can nicely see that we indeed have loaded variables from totally different
# iterations.
#
# ### Reading vector-valued functions
#
# When considering vector-valued functions, we need to specify the vector dimension of
# the function in order to read it back into python. We demonstrate this by considering
# the shape gradient of the problem solved above. This can be read into python with the
# code

shape_gradient = cashocs.io.read_function_from_xdmf(
    "./results/xdmf/shape_gradient.xdmf",
    "gradient_0",
    "CG",
    1,
    vector_dim=2,
    step=5,
)

# Here, we load the shape gradient at the fifth iteration and visualize it with the code

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
plot(shape_gradient)
plt.title("Shape Gradient at the fifth iteration")
plt.tight_layout()
# plt.savefig("./img_shape_gradient.png", dpi=150, bbox_inches="tight")

# The result looks as follows
# ![](/../../demos/documented/misc/xdmf_io/img_shape_gradient.png)
