Optimization of an Obstacle in Stokes Flow
==========================================

Problem Formulation
-------------------

For this tutorial, we investigate a problem similarly to the ones considered in, e.g.,
`Blauth, Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Methods for PDE Constrained Shape Optimization
Based on Steklov-Poincaré-Type Metrics <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12891>`_ and
`Schulz and Siebenborn, Computational Comparison of Surface Metric for PDE Constrained Shape Optimization
<https://doi.org/10.1515/cmam-2016-0009>`_, which reads:

.. math::

    &\min_\Omega J(u, \Omega) = \int_{\Omega^\text{flow}} Du : Du\ \text{ d}x \\
    &\text{subject to } \quad \left\lbrace \quad
    \begin{alignedat}{2}
        - \Delta u + \nabla p &= 0 \quad &&\text{ in } \Omega, \\
        \text{div}(u) &= 0 \quad &&\text{ in } \Omega, \\
        u &= u^\text{in} \quad &&\text{ on } \Gamma^\text{in}, \\
        u &= 0 \quad &&\text{ on } \Gamma^\text{wall} \cup \Gamma^\text{obs}, \\
        \partial_n u - p n &= 0 \quad &&\text{ on } \Gamma^\text{out}.
    \end{alignedat}
    \right.

Here, we have an inflow boundary condition on the inlet :math:`\Gamma^\text{in}`,
a no-slip boundary condition on the wall boundary :math:`\Gamma^\text{wall}` as well
as the obstacle boundary :math:`\Gamma^\text{obs}`, and a do-nothing condition
on the outlet :math:`\Gamma^\text{out}`.

This problem is supplemented with the geometrical constraints

.. math::

    \text{vol}(\Omega) = \int_\Omega 1 \text{ d}x &= \int_{\Omega_0} 1 \text{ d}x = \text{vol}(\Omega_0), \\
    \text{bary}(\Omega) = \frac{1}{\text{vol}(\Omega)} \int_\Omega x \text{ d}x &= \frac{1}{\text{vol}(\Omega_0)} \int_{\Omega_0} x \text{ d}x = \text{bary}(\Omega_0),

where :math:`\Omega_0` denotes the initial geometry. This models that both the volume
and the barycenter of the geometry should remain fixed during the optimization.
To treat this problem with CASHOCS, we regularize the constraints in the sense
of a quadratic penalty function. See :ref:`the corresponding section in the documentation
of the config files for shape optimization <config_shape_regularization>` as well
as :ref:`demo_regularization`. In particular, the regularized problem reads

.. math::

    \min_\Omega J(u, \Omega) = &\int_{\Omega^\text{flow}} Du : Du\ \text{ d}x +
    \frac{\mu_\text{vol}}{2} \left( \int_\Omega 1 \text{ d}x - \text{vol}(\Omega_0) \right)^2 \\
    &+ \frac{\mu_\text{bary}}{2} \left\lvert \frac{1}{\text{vol}(\Omega)} \int_\Omega x \text{ d}x - \text{bary}(\Omega_0) \right\rvert^2 \\
    &\text{subject to } \quad \left\lbrace \quad
    \begin{alignedat}{2}
        - \Delta u + \nabla p &= 0 \quad &&\text{ in } \Omega, \\
        \text{div}(u) &= 0 \quad &&\text{ in } \Omega, \\
        u &= u^\text{in} \quad &&\text{ on } \Gamma^\text{in}, \\
        u &= 0 \quad &&\text{ on } \Gamma^\text{wall} \cup \Gamma^\text{obs}, \\
        \partial_n u - p n &= 0 \quad &&\text{ on } \Gamma^\text{out}.
    \end{alignedat}
    \right.

where we have no additional geometrical constraints. However, the parameters
:math:`\mu_\text{vol}` and :math:`\mu_\text{bary}` have to be sufficiently large,
so that the regularized constraints are satisfied approximately.

Note, that the domain :math:`\Omega` denotes the domain of the obstacle, but that
the cost functional involves an integral over the flow domain :math:`\Omega^\text{flow}`.
Therefore, we switch our point of view and optimize the geometry of the flow instead
(which of course includes the optimization of the "hole" generated by the obstacle).
In particular, only the boundary of the obstacle :math:`\Gamma^\text{obs}` is deformable, all remaining boundaries
are fixed. Hence, it is equivalent to pose the geometrical constraints on
:math:`\Omega` and :math:`\Omega^\text{flow}`, so that we can work completely with the
flow domain.

As (initial) domain, we consider the rectangle :math:`(-2, 2) \times (-3, 3)`
without a circle centered in the origin with radius ``0.5``. The correspondig
geometry is created with GMSH, and can be found in the ``./mesh/`` directory.


Implementation
--------------

The complete python code can be found in the file :download:`demo_shape_stokes.py </../../demos/documented/shape_optimization/shape_stokes/demo_shape_stokes.py>`,
and the corresponding config can be found in :download:`config.ini </../../demos/documented/shape_optimization/shape_stokes/config.ini>`.

Initialization
**************

As for the previous tutorial problems, we start by importing FEniCS and CASHOCS::

    config = cashocs.load_config('./config.ini')

Afterwards we import the (initial) geometry with the :py:func:`import_mesh <cashocs.import_mesh>`
command ::

    mesh, subdomains, boundaries, dx, ds, dS = cashocs.import_mesh('./mesh/mesh.xdmf')

.. note::

    As defined in ``./mesh/mesh.geo``, we have the following boundaries

    - The inlet boundary :math:`\Gamma^\text{in}`, which has index ``1``
    - The wall boundary :math:`\Gamma^\text{wall}`, which have index ``2``
    - The outlet boundary :math:`\Gamma^\text{out}`, which has index ``3``
    - The boundary of the obstacle :math:`\Gamma^\text{obs}`, which has index ``4``

    To include the fact that only the obstacle boundary, with index 4, is deformable,
    we have the following lines in the config file ::

        [ShapeGradient]
        shape_bdry_def = [4]
        shape_bdry_fix = [1,2,3]

    which ensures that only :math:`\Gamma^\text{obs}` is deformable.

State system
************

The definition of the state system is analogous to the one we considered in
:ref:`demo_stokes`. Here, we, too, use LBB stable Taylor-Hood elements, which are
defined as ::

    v_elem = VectorElement('CG', mesh.ufl_cell(), 2)
    p_elem = FiniteElement('CG', mesh.ufl_cell(), 1)
    V = FunctionSpace(mesh, MixedElement([v_elem, p_elem]))

For the weak form of the PDE, we have the same code as in :ref:`demo_stokes` ::

    up = Function(V)
    u, p = split(up)
    vq = Function(V)
    v, q = split(vq)

    e = inner(grad(u), grad(v))*dx - p*div(v)*dx - q*div(u)*dx

The Dirichlet boundary conditions are slightly different, though. For the inlet
velocity :math:`u^\text{in}` we use a parabolic profile ::

    u_in = Expression(('-1.0/4.0*(x[1] - 2.0)*(x[1] + 2.0)', '0.0'), degree=2)
    bc_in = DirichletBC(V.sub(0), u_in, boundaries, 1)

The wall and obstacle boundaries get a no-slip boundary condition, each, with the
line ::

    bc_no_slip = cashocs.create_bcs_list(V.sub(0), Constant((0,0)), boundaries, [2,4])

Finally, all Dirichlet boundary conditions are gathered into the list ``bcs`` ::

    bcs = [bc_in] + bc_no_slip

.. note::

    The outflow boundary condition is of Neumann type and already included in the
    weak form of the problem.

Cost functional and optimization problem
****************************************

The cost functional is easily defined with the line ::

    J = inner(grad(u), grad(u))*dx

.. note::

    The additional regularization terms are defined similarly to :ref:`demo_regularization`.
    In the config file, we have the following (relevant) lines::

        [Regularization]
        factor_volume = 1e4
        use_initial_volume = True
        factor_barycenter = 1e5
        use_initial_barycenter = True

    This ensures that we use :math:`\mu_\text{vol} = 1e4` and :math:`\mu_\text{bary} = 1e5`,
    which are comparatively large parameters, so that the geometrical constraints are satisfied
    with high accuracy.
    Moreover, the boolean flags ``use_initial_volume`` and ``use_initial_barycenter``,
    which are both set to ``True``, ensure that we actually use the volume and
    barycenter of the initial geometry.

Finally, we solve the shape optimization problem as previously with the commands ::

    sop = cashocs.ShapeOptimizationProblem(e, bcs, J, up, vq, boundaries, config)
    sop.solve()

.. note::

    For the definition of the shape gradient, we use the same parameters for the
    linear elasticity equations as in `Blauth, Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Methods for PDE Constrained Shape Optimization
    Based on Steklov-Poincaré-Type Metrics <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12891>`_ and
    `Schulz and Siebenborn, Computational Comparison of Surface Metric for PDE Constrained Shape Optimization
    <https://doi.org/10.1515/cmam-2016-0009>`_. These are defined in the config file
    in the :ref:`ShapeGradient section <config_shape_shape_gradient>` ::

        lambda_lame = 0.0
        damping_factor = 0.0
        mu_fix = 1
        mu_def = 5e2

    so that we use a rather high stiffness for the elements at the deformable boundary,
    which is also discretized finely, and a rather low stiffness for the fixed
    boundaries.

.. note::

    This demo might take a little longer than the others, depending on the machine
    it is run on. This is normal, and caused by the finer discretization of the geometry
    compared to the previous problems.

The results should look like this
