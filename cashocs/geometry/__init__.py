"""Mesh generation, quality, and management tools.

This module consists of tools for the fast generation of meshes into
fenics. The :py:func:`regular_mesh <cashocs.geometry.regular_mesh>` and
:py:func:`regular_box_mesh <cashocs.geometry.regular_box_mesh>` commands create 2D and
3D box meshes which are great for testing and development.
