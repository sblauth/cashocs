        mesh: The dolfin mesh object, representing the computational domain.
        boundaries: A meshfunction for the boundaries, which is needed in case specific
            boundaries are targeted for the distance computation (while others are

            should be set to 0.0 for most applications, which is also the default. One
            exception is for turbulence modeling and wall functions.
        method: Which method should be used to compute the boundary distance. Can either
            be 'poisson' or 'eikonal'. The default is 'eikonal', which is more accurate.
            The poisson approach is less accurate, but more robust and gives a very
