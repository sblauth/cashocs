r"""cashocs is a shape optimization and optimal control software for python.

cashocs is based on the finite element package `FEniCS <https://fenicsproject.org>`_
and uses its high-level unified form language UFL to treat general PDE constrained
optimization problems, in particular, shape optimization and optimal control problems.

The documentation for cashocs can be found `here <https://cashocs.readthedocs.io/>`_.
